# detection_emotion_tensorflow_keras
This model uses tensorflow and hard for the detection of human face emotions. Tensorflow activation function uses softmax due to multilabel classification. This repository is part one, which is to make a training and testing model which later on part two will use this model in the application of detection with Android
